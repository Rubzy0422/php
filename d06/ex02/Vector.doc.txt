Vector:
	new Vector( array( 'dest' => VertexInstance, 'orig' => VertexInstance );
		'orig' default = (0,0,0);

	use getters to get values

	Methods:

		- magnitude() : give the norme of the instanced Vector.

		- normalize() : give the normalized Vector correspondig (a fresh copy
		if the instance was already normalized)

		- add( Vector $v ) : give the result of the addition between
		the current instance and $.

		- sub( Vector $v ) : give the result of the substraction between
		the current instance and $.

		- opposite() : return the opposite Vector;

		- scalarProduct( $k ) : return the product of the constant $k
		and the current instance;

		- dotProduct( Vector $v ) : return the scalar product of the current
		instance and $v.

		- cos( Vector $v ) : return the cosinus between the current instance and $v

		Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : return the cross product
		(right handed set) of the current instance and $v
